  Sample Applications

Version 2.02
  Minor updates to several Example applications.

Version 2.01
  Fixed a significant bug in Image32_Ttf.

Version 2.0
  This is a major update. There are many changes (mainly 
  to the Image32_Layers unit), and some of these changes 
  are very likely to break your existing code. Sorry.
  
  The Image32_Layers unit has been completely rewritten.
  The old unit was poorly written and cumbersome to use.
  The most significant change in the new layers unit is the 
  use of nested groups of layers that form a tree structure
  under TLayeredImage32.Root. This structure provides several
  advantages over the old flat layer structure. These include
  faster merges, and much simpler control over layer groups.
  Hit-testing has also been dramatically improved, being
  both much simpler to setup, and faster at detecting the 
  correct layer.
  
  The Image32_Text unit that was deprecated has been removed. 
  The Image32_Ttf unit provides all the functionality of the 
  old Image32_Text unit but, unlike its predecessor, supports 
  cross-platform development.
  
  Other units have had attention with minor bug fixes and 
  assorted embellishments, including a significant code tidy
  of the esoteric Image32_SmoothPath unit.

  The sample applications have also had significant revision.
  Some overly complicated apps have been removed, while others
  have been rewritten and simplified.

  The documentation has also been updated to address most if
  not all these changes.
