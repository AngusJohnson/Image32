Image32 Installation and upgrade instructions

1. If you are upgrading the Image32 library from
   a version prior to version 3.0 then you'll first need to
   uninstall the VCL_Image32 package if it was installed.

2. Unzip the Library into an appropriate (empty) folder.

3. Add the library's source folder to the Delphi IDE library path.
    To do this in Delphi 10.3 select from the menu -
      Tools | Options | Language | Delphi | Library | Library Path
    To do this in Delphi 7 select from the menu -
      Tools | Environment Options | Library | Library Path

4. Install the TImage32Panel control (optional)
    In the Delphi IDE, choose File | Open Project and in 
    the "Files of Type" EditCombox select Delphi Packages
    Then navigate to the library's source/packages folder and 
    open the Img32_VCL package. Compile and install.
      
5. Test the install by opening and compiling a sample application.


6. UPGRADING CODE FROM OLDER VERSIONS OF IMAGE32 TO VERSION 3:
   There's an upgrade utility in the zip package that will make 
   most or all the necessary changes to any applications that use
   the Image32 library. The utility will back up files before 
   making changes but, even so, do your own backup first. Then
   compile and run the utility and point it at any folder
   containing the code that will need updating. It will only
   modify *.dpr and *.pas files in that folder. There's no
   reporting and the utility just closes. You'll need to rerun
   the utility for each folder that has code for updating.
