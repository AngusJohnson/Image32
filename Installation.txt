      Tools | Options | Language | Delphi | Library | Library Path
    To do this in Delphi 7 select from the menu -
      Tools | Environment Options | Library | Library Path

3. Install the TImage32Panel control (optional)
    In the Delphi IDE, choose File | Open Project and in 
    the "Files of Type" EditCombox select Delphi Packages
    Navigate to the library's source/packages folder and 
    open the Img32_Library.dpk runtime package and compile.
    Then open Img32_VCL_Dsgn.dpk designtime package and 
    compile and install.
      
4. Test the install by compiling one or more sample applications.
   Note: Some sample apps won't compile in older versions of Delphi (eg FMX apps.)
